Fixed the compilation error by introducing an internal `receiveDeposit()` function that's called by both `deposit()` and `receive()`.\n2. Implemented all required functionalities: depositing, withdrawing, and calculating rewards.\n3. Used OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to prevent overflow/underflow issues.\n4. Followed the checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.\n5. Added more detailed error messages for better user experience.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract to your chosen network.\n2. Users can stake ETH by calling the `deposit()` function or simply sending ETH to the contract address.\n3. Users can withdraw their stake and rewards using the `withdraw()` function.\n4. The `calculateRewards()` function can be used to check pending rewards at any time.\n5. `getStakedBalance()` and `getTotalStaked()` provide information about individual and total stakes.\n\nPlease note that this contract uses a simplified reward calculation method. In a production environment, you might want to implement a more sophisticated reward mechanism and consider adding features like pausing, upgradeability, or adjustable reward rates.\n",
